This project, implemented in C++, showcases the CAWA(Criticality Aware Warp Accelerator) scheme on GPGPU-Sim. In order to implement CAWA, an accurate criticality predictor was built. Using the determined criticality, warp scheduling and cache prioritizing was done.



### In-Memory File System

This project, implemented in C++, involved constructing an in-memory file system using a FUSE interface. FUSE allows for custom callbacks for linux system calls, which are used to modify the file system accordingly. The File System was stress tested using postmark.

### Cernal
Simple Android App that scrubs CERN's RSS feed and generates a news feed. Fairly basic, but this is the first project where I learned to use APIs, parse XML.
